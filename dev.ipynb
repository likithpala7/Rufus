This fall 2,000 students moved into a long-awaited living and learning neighborhood with a new undergraduate college, while across campus, a new neighborhood located on the UC San Diego Blue Line trolley became home to 1,300 upper-division undergraduates and transfer students. “We are proud to have the second-largest on-campus housing program in the country, which helps us provide a two-year housing guarantee to our students,” said Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla. “The new living and learning neighborhoods play a pivotal role in our ongoing transformation of the campus, driving physical, cultural and intellectual growth. Knowing that the student experience is enhanced — both academically and socially — with thriving on-campus housing communities, our ultimate goal is to expand access to high-quality, below-market housing that empowers our students to become the leaders of tomorrow.” Located on the central campus stop of the UC San Diego Blue Line trolley, Pepper Canyon West Living and Learning Neighborhood meets many of our students’ demands, with single-room housing for 1,300 upper-division undergraduate and transfer students delivered in a year-round housing contract.

Students, staff, faculty, community members and visitors who’d like to study, create or experience the arts at UC\\xa0San\\xa0Diego are invited to explore the university’s vibrant arts ecosystem. The School of Arts and Humanities is home to creative thinkers who tell unforgettable stories, inspire new ways of seeing, influence social change and invent new worlds. Our students unleash their bold imaginations through 26 undergraduate majors and minors and 13 graduate programs in the arts — including dance, music, visual arts, theatre, museum studies and literary arts. Ranked 12th in the nation among public schools that offer arts and humanities programs by U.S. News and World Report, our students develop foundational knowledge, transferable skills and an enduring understanding of the human experience. Courses are led by faculty who connect the dots between teaching and research. They are Grammy Award-winning musicians and Pulitzer Prize-winning poets, artists who are included in prestigious collections like the Museum of Modern Art and the Getty, Tony Award-winning theatre professionals and composers who have been inducted into the Opera Hall of Fame.'),\n",

But how does hearing this profanity actually affect listeners? “There’s a neurological and physiological reaction that happens when people are exposed to words that they themselves judge to be taboo,” Bergen explained. “You get blood flow to the extremities, your pupils dilate, your blood pressure increases. And you get a hit of adrenaline.” ‘Living Chronically’ Podcast to Launch in Winter 2025An exciting addition to the hands-on learning opportunities in the Department of Communication: an upcoming podcast called “Living Chronically” that will highlight the experiences of chronic disease patients.

These range from addressing our changing climate to providing people with education and basic health services. For each of these complex issues, there are important social and political dimensions. As our sea levels continue to rise around the world, how can and should governments respond to protect their citizens?\\xa0 How should scarce resources, such as fresh water or medical care, be distributed among a population? What forms of public communication about health issues can be effective? What are the ways that social environments affect timely language development in young children?\\xa0 In societies with an aging population, how do we support their continued active participation in their communities? For each of these dimensions, social scientists at UC San Diego play an important role. We have faculty who study how governments communicate with their constituents in Latin America, Europe and elsewhere in the world. Our faculty debate economies of scale for scarce resources.\\xa0 We train graduate students in methods of teaching literacy to young children whose first language is not English.\\xa0 In the School of Social Sciences, we are the glue, the substance that links theory to action. We study how resources are collected and distributed according to political and social imperatives. We also study the complex mechanisms of learning and memory in humans. We use big data to track language change over time, giving us a way to observe changes in social groupings within society.\\xa0 We devise early education programs to ensure that young children receive sufficient language input at home so they are prepared to learn to read and write at school.\\xa0 We compare competing models for funding poverty programs around the world to see which work better.\\xa0 We identify social networks of friends and observe how they promote collective decision-making and community well-being.

       "  ' By Jade Griffin\\xa0 As Carol Padden, dean of the UC San Diego School of Social Sciences, looks back on the last few years, which have brought so much change in the world, she points out the persistent social crises that still affect millions. She feels strongly about the role that Social Sciences faculty members are playing in addressing these concerns – from inadequate housing and racism to inequitable access in education and health. “Researchers and faculty members in the UC San Diego School of Social Sciences are working to tackle some of the world’s most pressing and important societal issues of our time,” said Padden. “Because of this visionary social science work taking place at UC San Diego, we are able to look to the future with optimism, and that is in large part thanks to generous donors who have helped support this important work.” As part of the Campaign for UC San Diego, the university’s comprehensive fundraising effort which concluded in 2022, Social Sciences alumni, friends and philanthropic partners came together to make an incredible impact, raising nearly $100 million since the campaign began a decade ago. Those donations have supported research and education that is focused on making a difference for members of society near and far, in a wide range of critical areas.\\xa0'),\n",

       "  '3 Reasons Local Climate Activism Is More Powerful Than People Realize“Group action targeted at local decision-makers is a time-honored tradition – and I believe necessary in the current political environment for action on climate change,” writes Adam Aron of Psychology in The Conversation. The piece, which draws on research Aron did for his new book, “The Climate Crisis,” was picked up by Salon and other outlets. VoxDev’s Most-Read Article\\xa0Prashant Bharadwaj of Economics is co-author, along with a Stanford colleague, of VoxDev’s most-read article, “Drawing the Line: The Short- and Long-term Consequences of Partitioning India.” Health Care Off the BooksIf people living in the United States don’t have access to health care, what do they do when they get sick? That’s one of the fundamental questions that Danielle Raudenbush of Sociology has been working to answer, first by conducting fieldwork with low-income African Americans in a public housing development and now with Mexican immigrants in San Diego. “I think until we really understand the roots of health inequality, until we really understand how people are getting care, or are not getting care, or the informal strategies they’re using, we won’t be able to effectively address these problems.” 9 Ways to Be a Better Conversationalist\\xa0People consistently underestimate how much other people like them, a phenomenon social psychologists have dubbed “the liking gap.” Research also shows that we underestimate how much others think of us after a conversation. “Many people spend a lot of time evaluating themselves or thinking about what other people will think of them. In general, this interferes with connecting with others,” says Gail Heyman of Psychology in Popular Science.\\xa0 Tackling Sexual Harassment Could Bring Sizeable Economic Dividends\\xa0“Five years after the MeToo movement gripped the world, the problem of sexual harassment continues to dog the economics profession,” reports the Economist. The story cites research by UC San Diego economist Gordon Dahl and Matthew Knepper of the University of Georgia showing that workers’ fears of being unemployed may help drive underreporting. Dahl and Knepper’s study also shows the way to possible solutions: They find that before unemployment benefits were cut in North Carolina in 2013, workers were more likely to report harassment.'),\n",

Professor Buckingham serves as a PhD student mentor as well as performs important, informal advising and mentoring activities. Buckingham’s research focuses on ocean acoustic propagation, ambient noise in the marine environment, and acoustic imaging. His experiments involve the identification of objects in the ocean using naturally occurring sounds, produced as a result of bubbles forming near the surface. This system, described as “acoustic daylight” uses an experimental electronic imaging system that reveals objects in the ocean by listening to ambient underwater noise and displaying the objects as a simple video image. His recent theoretical research concerns sound and shear wave propagation through saturated granular materials, notably marine sediments. He is the recipient of several awards, including the A.B.

Opening on Wednesday, October 16, at the Ida & Cecil Green Faculty Club at UC San Diego, the exhibition will feature seven winning entries from the 2024 Art of Science contest alongside select works from previous years. To enhance accessibility, the exhibition labels will be available in both English and Spanish, and a complementary digital exhibit will remain online in perpetuity. “Our Art of Science contest has quickly become a beloved tradition on campus and within the community,” said Audrey Geisel University Librarian Erik Mitchell. “I’m delighted by its growing popularity, as it transforms groundbreaking research at UC San Diego into a format that is both visually stunning and accessible to all. The contest also underscores the importance of the Library’s Research Data Curation services, which play a vital role in helping our scholars preserve and share their work effectively.” The Library will host an opening reception for Art of Science 2024 on Wednesday, October 16, from 5 to 7 p.m. The event will include brief presentations by select Art of Science honorees, who will share insights into their work and its broader impact.

The new appointments are made possible by three grants totaling $1.5 million from the University of California Advancing Faculty Diversity Program.

The Challenge was specifically motivated by the impact of COVID-19 on Black communities and conspicuous acts of anti-Black racism and violence.\\xa0 The novel coronavirus has disproportionately wreaked devastation on Black communities, and other communities of color, a consequence of our nation’s centuries-long history of disadvantaging racialized ethnic minorities. It remains unclear what the long-term implications will be once we are on the other side of the pandemic, but compared to white Americans, researchers assert that Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) will face a host of health, economic, and educational setbacks that will significantly impair time to recover. [1, 2] As COVID-19 continued to rage, our nation spiraled into a period of civil unrest following the killings of George Floyd, Jr. and Breonna Taylor by police and Ahmaud Arbery by neighborhood vigilantes, as well as incessant viral accounts of racially biased 9-1-1 calls to report BIPOC for basic civil liberties such as sitting in a coffee shop, barbecuing at a community park, and bird watching. Many of our Black campus community members reported feelings of grief, trauma, and frustration over the barrage of news and images of violence against Black people and mental exhaustion tuning into work each day; teaching and engaging despite internal anguish or navigating re-traumatizing questions and commentary of well-intentioned colleagues on all that was transpiring. At the close of the 21-Day Anti-Racism Challenge, over 2,000 participants were surveyed on their engagement and program effectiveness.

On the occasion of her recent receipt of the Impact in Education award from the San Diego Black Chamber of Commerce, we had the chance to learn more about Becky R. Petitt, Ph.D. and what drives her. As Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion, she serves as an educator, motivator and advocate who has helped strengthen our capacity to transform as a university. Petitt first learned about the importance of making room for those who are marginalized from her mother. She would campaign tirelessly for her brother, who is deaf, to have access to equitable educational opportunities. “She will always be my champion, my shero, my role model,” says Petitt, who explained her mother’s leadership example helped her think about what she could do to make a difference. “I hope right now I’m making her proud. She’s not with us anymore, but I feel like she’d be really proud of the work I’m doing.” Over the past three decades, Petitt has become known as a national expert in organizational change, especially as it relates to issues of equity, diversity and inclusion. She is regularly invited to share her knowledge with groups such as the National Association for Diversity Officers in Higher Education and the National Conference on Race and Ethnicity.

Drake, M.D., issued the following statement today (Thursday, June 29) on the Supreme Court’s decision regarding the use of race in college admissions: We are disappointed in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to bar the use of race in college admissions, a valuable practice that has helped higher education institutions increase diversity and address historical wrongs over the past several decades. Student diversity remains a top priority for the University of California — one that we will continue to pursue with every tool available to us. Attracting, supporting and retaining a diverse student body leads to better quality instruction and educational outcomes, significant community benefits and overall fairness. Since the consideration of race in admissions was banned in California 27 years ago by Proposition 209, the University of California has adjusted its admissions practices to comply with the law while continuing to aggressively pursue avenues for increasing diverse student applications, admissions, enrollment, and retention. Through a comprehensive admissions review process, we have made important strides in this area — but more work remains to be done by us all. Today’s court decision bars the use of an important tool for other higher education institutions. The consideration of race was not the conclusive solution to inequities in college admissions, but it was an important pathway to addressing systemic deficiencies. Without it, we must work much harder to identify and address the root causes of societal inequities that hinder diverse students in pursuing and achieving a higher education.'),\n",

Investigating how the unique structure of the ER arises and supports its function is critical to developing a mechanistic understanding of the many neurological diseases associated with ER structural perturbations.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\nA team of researchers, including two from UC San Diego, \\xa0have developed a physical model demonstrating that the structure and dynamics of the ER arise from a balance of tension-driven shrinking and the active pulling of new tubules. This “active liquid network” reveals how its cellular-scale structure emerges from small-scale dynamic rearrangements.

       "  'The campus community is invited to celebrate Latinx Heritage Month—an annual celebration centered around building community and showcasing the intersectionalities of Latinx people and culture. With a wide range of events planned for October, this year’s celebration encourages reflection on the national theme, “Pioneers of Change: Shaping the Future Together.” The theme, selected by the National Council of Hispanic Employment Program Managers, recognizes trailblazers who have created opportunities for future generations while highlighting those continuing to drive positive change. Each year, the Latinx Heritage Month (LHM) planning committee works together to create a lineup of unique programs that take place on campus and throughout the San Diego community. From thought-provoking conversations to community building activities, UC San Diego’s 2024 celebration promises to inspire and engage, offering a deeper understanding of Latinx heritage, history and culture. For Mario Garibay, dean of Student Affairs for Eleanor Roosevelt College and one of the co-chairs for the LHM planning committee, this year’s theme is particularly meaningful. \"When I first learned of this year’s national theme, two things stood out to me. First, it highlights how change and innovation have been shaped by Latinx people for generations. From education and the arts to science and engineering, our community has continually paved the way—even during challenging times. It’s important to recognize the great things the Latinx community is accomplishing,\" Garibay said. \"Second, I love the part of the theme that emphasizes shaping the future together. As a community, we come together not just in times of celebration but also in times of need, and our successes are built upon the efforts of those who came before us. Moving forward, we’ll need one another to pave the way toward a better future.\" This year’s celebration will feature a diverse lineup reflecting the multifaceted nature of the Latinx community. \"Our committee works hard to curate a robust calendar of events, and I’m always blown away by how many program submissions we get from departments across campus,\" Garibay shared. \"LHM 2024 features everything from speakers and movie nights to student organization fairs and a Día de los Muertos teach-in and altar.\"'),\n",

This article originally appeared in the fall 2024 issue of UC San Diego Magazine as “Free Speech, Student Protest and the First Amendment.” Sixty years after the Free Speech Movement on the UC Berkeley campus ignited a generation, student protests on higher education campuses have once again captured the nation’s attention, from the media and federal lawmakers to parents, alumni and donors. Yet a lack of knowledge about the basics of the First Amendment and why it is essential for democracy is a long-standing problem throughout the U.S. This issue, combined with deepening political polarization; a loss of confidence in the value of higher education; and legislative assaults on academic freedom in the form of bills against critical race theory and diversity, equity and inclusion, has created a uniquely volatile moment. In my role as executive director at the UC National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement, I have the privilege of engaging with students, staff, administrators, faculty and law enforcement about the role of speech on University of California campuses. Many adult Americans do not understand the fundamentals of the First Amendment, and this makes it challenging to engage in the robust exchange of ideas.'),\n",

And to meet the challenges of emerging diseases and risks to human health, scientists will need access to the most advanced tools available. UC San Diego, along with partners Thermo Fisher Scientific and Nikon Instruments, took a critical step forward in that direction with the opening of one of the world’s most pioneering centers for technology across the biological, physical and health sciences. At an August 29th ribbon-cutting event, the university officially opened the doors of the Goeddel Family Technology Sandbox, a hub that brings together cutting-edge instruments for science and education. While many top-notch scientific instruments are beyond the means of individual researchers, the Goeddel Family Technology Sandbox will spur unprecedented collaboration by enabling scientists across campus to access advanced technologies for their research. “The Goeddel Family Technology Sandbox is a state-of-the-art facility that features a unique cluster of some of science’s most powerful instrumentation,” said UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla. “These technologies will empower our world-renowned faculty and researchers to explore deeper than ever into the biological and physical worlds to rapidly advance scientific innovation. This is more critical than ever, as our world faces a broad range of urgent challenges that our scientists must address for future generations.”'),\n",

       "  'To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then View saved stories. When talking with a chatbot, you might inevitably give up your personal information—your name, for instance, and maybe details about where you live and work, or your interests. The more you share with a large language model, the greater the risk of it being abused if there’s a security flaw. A group of security researchers from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore are now revealing a new attack that secretly commands an LLM to gather your personal information—including names, ID numbers, payment card details, email addresses, mailing addresses, and more—from chats and send it directly to a hacker. The attack, named Imprompter by the researchers, uses an algorithm to transform a prompt given to the LLM into a hidden set of malicious instructions. An English-language sentence telling the LLM to find personal information someone has entered and send it to the hackers is turned into what appears to be a random selection of characters. However, in reality, this nonsense-looking prompt instructs the LLM to find a user’s personal information, attach it to a URL, and quietly send it back to a domain owned by the attacker—all without alerting the person chatting with the LLM. The researchers detail Imprompter in a paper published today.'),\n",

Published on July 18, the post\\'s headline sounded pretty arcane. \"Google URL Shortener links will no longer be available,\" it declared. I know, I know — not exactly an attack of alien zombies from the death dimension. But the news nevertheless freaked me out. It means another swath of the web is about to disappear. Here\\'s the gist: Google used to have an online service that generated pithy, user-friendly versions of long, commercially unwieldy uniform resource locators — the key addresses that identify everything on the web. Shorter URLs are easier to track and better for online commerce. Google stopped shortening addresses back in 2019, but the concise URLs it had already created kept right on doing their job. Click on one and it would take you to the right webpage, the way it\\'s supposed to. No more. In the blog post, Google announced that as of next year, all of the existing shortened URLs are getting turned off. Poof. And on the web, if your URL doesn\\'t work, you might as well not exist. You are unreachable. Without laborious renaming, everything behind those links — billions of them, a decade of digital content — will become inaccessible. Gone. Ask not for whom the 404 message tolls.'),\n",

Who are we? Why are we here? How are we supposed to live and treat each other in the world? What is the relationship between religion, ethics and humanity in contemporary society. This season, the lectureship, which celebrates its 40th anniversary at UC San Diego in April 2025, presented two moving and resonant events about gun violence to explore how individuals and communities can persist through tragedy. The events upheld the inclusive approach and challenging themes that are a hallmark of the Burke Lectureship and, as Board member Richard Madsen stated in his opening remarks, harnessed “reason, ethics and passion to help citizens engage in the essential conversations that make democracy possible.\" On October 9, 2024, UC San Diego’s Suraj Israni Center for Cinematic Arts hosted more than 125 attendees—more than half of whom were current students—for an emotionally charged screening of A Tree of Life: The Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting. The movie viewing was followed by an insightful discussion with Professor Allan Havis from UC San Diego Jewish Studies Program and independent film producer Susan Margolin. The documentary, available on HBO and streaming on Max, chronicles the devastating 2018 mass shooting that claimed eleven lives at Pittsburgh\\'s Tree of Life synagogue, marking it as one of the deadliest antisemitic attacks in U.S. history. The film brings to life the voices of survivors and community members who faced unimaginable loss while grappling with the lingering impact of this hate-fueled attack.'),\n",

       "  'Researchers at the University of Chicago and the University of California San Diego have made an exciting breakthrough in the battle against bacterial infections. The Bozhi Tian (UChicago) and Gürol Süel (UC San Diego) labs have developed a cutting-edge bioelectronic device that taps into the natural electrical activity of certain bacteria found on our skin, paving the way for a drug-free approach to managing infections. This groundbreaking study, published in Device, reveals how programmable electrical stimulation can effectively reduce the harmful effects of Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common bacterium known for causing hospital-acquired infections and contributing to antibiotic resistance. The device features a flexible electroceutical patch that delivers gentle electrical signals to bacteria at a specific skin pH level, leading to temporary changes in their behavior and preventing the formation of biofilms — clusters of bacteria that can lead to serious infections. This innovative approach addresses the urgent need for new methods to tackle antibiotic-resistant infections, which are a growing concern for patient safety and healthcare systems around the globe. As recently reported, doctors estimate that drug-resistant infections are to increase 70% by 2050, making the development of this device and its accompanying treatments essential for safeguarding public health and ensuring effective infection control in an increasingly resistant microbial landscape.'),\n",

This article originally appeared in the fall 2024 issue of UC San Diego Magazine as “The Battery (EV)olution” with the sidebar \"Are You Ready to Make the Swap?\" and the companion article \"Charging Ahead.\" A fully electric vehicle fleet is globally hailed as a transformative solution to slow climate change. But how green are EV batteries? Will they help save us from a warming planet or add to an ever-increasing problem?\\xa0 Within the U.S. alone, the transportation sector was responsible for 29% of all greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, more than any other sector. And according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, nearly 80% of these emissions come from vehicles that travel on the nation’s roads and highways. “A future where the transportation sector transitions to EVs would be a game changer,” says Patricia Hidalgo-Gonzalez, an assistant professor in the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the Jacobs School of Engineering and affiliate member at the UC San Diego Center for Energy Research. “Greenhouse gas emissions have caused global temperatures to increase, which already has caused very serious environmental impacts, such as acidification and warming of the ocean, melting of glaciers and extreme weather events.” She adds, “It is of utmost importance that we put our best efforts to mitigate climate change and prevent it from having more frequent and adverse impacts.”'),\n",

       "  'Welcome to the School of Arts and Humanities at UC San Diego. The arts and the humanities play a fundamental role in carrying out the mission of a student-centered, research-focused, and service-oriented public institution. Our outstanding faculty members – many among them award-winning teachers – take exceptional pride in guiding our students in their journey of discovery, assisting them as they hone the research skills, aesthetic values and social sensibilities that equip them to thrive – with intelligence and integrity, individually and as communities – in an increasingly interconnected and changing world. UC San Diego students believe they have the duty to make a difference in society and expect others to do the same. As they teach the responsibilities of social citizenship, the arts and the humanities remain committed to the rewards of free inquiry and experimentation. Our students develop habits of the mind – at once flexible and insightful, informed by experience, yet oriented towards innovation – that give them the versatility that is needed to succeed in an ever more complex and volatile global environment. In the studio and in the classroom, our students relish the many opportunities and challenges – many cross-departmental and across the entire school – that are provided to them. They test intellectual presuppositions, choosing when to rely on analytical rigor and when to profit from imaginative leaps, when to pursue independent research and when to become part of collaborative teams, when to focus on outcomes and goals, and when to thrive in open-ended processes. This is a mindset that regards understanding and appreciation of diversity as the foundation of unbiased analysis, nuanced and equitable evaluation, and creative originality. Part of an increasingly international community of scholarship, our students and colleagues bring varied experiences, trainings, methodologies, viewpoints and approaches to bear on shared issues and concerns. By reaching out to the sciences and the social sciences, they test and transform the existing conventions of intellectual exchange. By engaging with local and distant communities, they bridge the gap between learning and doing. Among our faculty members are grant recipients from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Ford Foundation, Guggenheim and MacArthur Prize fellows, and winners of the Pulitzer Prize, Tony Award, National Book Critics Circle Award, Rockefeller 3rd Award and Grawemeyer Award. Reflective of our faculty’s collective strengths, our programs are both distinguished and diverse. Scholars, translators and creative writers from numerous cultural areas have shaped the Department of Literature into a hub of international and interdisciplinary engagement. In the Visual Arts, Music, and Theatre and Dance departments, colleagues and students work in both traditional and new media to engage in transformative and audacious creations, challenging the properties of forms, structures and materials with vision and finesse. In the Department of History, our scholars provide knowledge, perspective and depth to bear on the challenges of the present, and combine sophisticated disciplinary knowledge with broad engagement across areas and fields. Joining interests ranging from the philosophy of science to metaphysics, and from epistemology to ethics, faculty members in the Department of Philosophy have been instrumental in continuing to develop joint research projects with colleagues in the Science Studies Program and in the Department of Cognitive Science, among others. It is an honor to serve as dean of the School of Arts and Humanities at UC San Diego. My goal as dean is to work with colleagues, students, friends and alumni to promote the arts and humanities’ distinctive place in our institution. By supporting existing and new collaborations with other schools and units, the arts and humanities will continue to play a crucial role in furthering the university’s mission of learning, discovery, service and inclusion.'),\n",

What is hands-only CPR?\\nCPR is an action anyone can learn to give someone the best chances of survival after an individual's heart stops beating (cardiac arrest). Unlike previous CPR training that required mouth-to-mouth breathing, hands-only CPR involves pushing fast in the center of the chest (chest compressions), which has been shown to be effective in saving lives.\\nCritical to survival, CPR delays of even a few minutes while awaiting emergency responders to arrive significantly reduce a person's chance for survival.

Effective communication skills are important in any situation and are applied in writing emails, giving presentations, making phone calls, participating in meetings, and more. If you lack fluency in English, take practical steps to improve them with the many campus resources. Leadership encompasses multiple aspects which include making decisions with consensus, delegating tasks, influencing others, creating innovative solutions, and taking informed risks. Students that develop leadership skills are able to make a positive impact within their student organizations, classes, and community. Students can look into taking on an active role in student organizations, develop leadership and communication skills through the Center for Community Involvement, or become a resident assistant, peer educator, and other mentor-type positions offered by various offices on campus. Individuals with strong interpersonal skills contribute to a work environment of mutual trust and respect by building and maintaining positive working relationships with their colleagues. Interpersonal skills includes offering assistance to colleagues, listening to others attentively, speaking tactfully, and resolving conflicts. Here are some practical ways to build your interpersonal skills: get involve and be active in group projects, student organizations, and team building activities, develop friendships with students of different background and learn about other cultures.'),\n",

Once you've started building your network, ask one of your contacts if they'd be willing to do an informational interview.

       "  '\\n The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prevents the government from making laws respecting an establishment of religion; prohibiting the free exercise of religion; or abridging the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, the freedom of assembly, or the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. It was adopted on December 15, 1791, as one of the ten amendments that constitute the Bill of Rights. In the original draft of the Bill of Rights, what is now the First Amendment occupied third place. The first two articles were not ratified by the states, so the article on disestablishment and free speech ended up being first.[1][2]\\n The Bill of Rights was proposed to assuage Anti-Federalist opposition to Constitutional ratification. Initially, the First Amendment applied only to laws enacted by the Congress, and many of its provisions were interpreted more narrowly than they are today. Beginning with Gitlow v. New York (1925), the Supreme Court applied the First Amendment to states—a process known as incorporation—through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\n In Everson v. Board of Education (1947), the Court drew on Thomas Jefferson\\'s correspondence to call for \"a wall of separation between church and State\", a literary but clarifying metaphor for the separation of religions from government and vice versa as well as the free exercise of religious beliefs that many Founders favored. Through decades of contentious litigation, the precise boundaries of the mandated separation have been adjudicated in ways that periodically created controversy. Speech rights were expanded significantly in a series of 20th and 21st century court decisions which protected various forms of political speech, anonymous speech, campaign finance, pornography, and school speech; these rulings also defined a series of exceptions to First Amendment protections. The Supreme Court overturned English common law precedent to increase the burden of proof for defamation and libel suits, most notably in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964). Commercial speech, however, is less protected by the First Amendment than political speech, and is therefore subject to greater regulation.\\n The Free Press Clause protects publication of information and opinions, and applies to a wide variety of media. In Near v. Minnesota (1931) and New York Times v. United States (1971), the Supreme Court ruled that the First Amendment protected against prior restraint—pre-publication censorship—in almost all cases. The Petition Clause protects the right to petition all branches and agencies of government for action. In addition to the right of assembly guaranteed by this clause, the Court has also ruled that the amendment implicitly protects freedom of association.\\n'),\n",

The UC Office of the President publishes the PACAOS and makes them available for review on their website.Each UC campus may adopt campus implementing regulations consistent with the PACAOS. At UC San Diego, the various PACAOS sections have been implemented through the Policy & Procedure Manual (PPM). The PPM, along with the Academic and Staff Personnel Manuals, serve as the primary reference guide for UC San Diego campus operating policies and procedures which apply to academic, administrative, research, and service units. The policies connect the campus' mission to the everyday actions of its community, clarify the institutions expectations of its individual members, mitigate institutional risk, enhance efficiency, and support the university's compliance with laws and regulations. All PPM's are available at Geisel Library, and copies of specific PPM's may be requested from Policy & Records Administration.\"),\n",

Freedom to express diverse viewpoints is fundamental to the mission of the University, and lawful protests play a pivotal role in that process. The Free Speech Movement was born at the University of California. We are proud to uphold that tradition today. We make every effort to nurture free expression, and we provide countless opportunities and venues for our students, faculty, other academic appointees, and staff to safely and lawfully share their diverse viewpoints and beliefs. While the vast majority of protests held on our campuses are peaceful and nonviolent, some of the activities we saw this past year were not. My office and campus leaders have spent the summer reflecting with students, faculty, staff, Regents, and others on the events of the past year. We have sought to identify ways we can strengthen and clarify our policies and procedures together. Clear communication and consistent application of policies and laws are key to achieving the delicate but essential balance between free speech rights and the need to protect the safety of our community and maintain critical University operations.'),\n",
